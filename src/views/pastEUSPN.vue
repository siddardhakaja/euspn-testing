              Coimbra is a historical city and a municipality in Portugal. Among the many archaeological structures dating back to 
              the Roman era, when Coimbra was the settlement of Aeminium, are its well-preserved aqueduct and cryptoporticus. 
              Similarly, buildings from the period when Coimbra was the capital of Portugal (from 1131 to 1255) still remain. 
              During the late Middle Ages, with its decline as the political centre of the Kingdom of Portugal, Coimbra began to 
              evolve into a major cultural centre. This was in large part helped by the establishment of the University of Coimbra
               in 1290, the oldest academic institution in the Portuguese-speaking world. Apart from attracting many European and
                international students, the university is visited by many tourists for its monuments and history. Its historical 
                buildings were classified as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 2013: "Coimbra offers an outstanding example of an
                 integrated university city with a specific urban typology as well as its own ceremonial and cultural traditions 
                 that have been kept alive through the ages." Its atmospheric, beautiful historic core cascades down a hillside 
                 in a lovely setting on the east bank of the Rio Mondego: it's a multicoloured collage of buildings spanning nearly
                  a millennium.
